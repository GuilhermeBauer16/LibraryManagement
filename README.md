## Learnings.            
In this project, I learned how I can better use Java without the use of Spring Boot framework and how I can use better JPA with Hibernate. How to create relations between tables using the annotations @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, and @JoinCollumn. How to create a table for the connection between two tables. I also learned to personalize exceptions to make the exceptions more precise. And I Also learned how to organize my code-creating directors how to service, util, exception, and DAO. I also learned how to create a method for making the book active or disabled instead of deleting the book so as not to cause problems with the relationship between the tables.
